# Homework-06

This is my weather app called HTWUT(Hows the weather up there). I made 2 differet html files as well as jquery/ajax files for current weather and forcast. When you search for current weather you can see the weather, description, temperature, pressure, humidity, min and max temp, wind speed and wind direction with the appropriate icon. For Forcast you are able to see 1-5 future day of the weather.
