# Homework-06

This is my weather app called HTWUT(Hows the weather up there). I made 2 differet html files as well as jquery/ajax files for current weather and forcast. When you search for current weather you can see the weather, description, temperature, pressure, humidity, min and max temp, wind speed  wind direction and uv index with the appropriate icon. For Forcast you are able to see 1-5 future day of the weather.

This homework was more trouble than when I thought before I went on break. I did not get the localstorage or saved searches since I still have challenges with that. Other than that the app turned out pretty well with some minor tweaking.
